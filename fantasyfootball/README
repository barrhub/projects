These are instructions for running a simulated fantasy football season.  The stimulation was written for students in c105 ('Prediction, Probability, and Pigskin') taught by Ben Motz (bmotz@indiana.edu) at Indiana University.
  
To run the simulation follow these steps:
1.) Download the pigsim.R, week12db.csv, pointsdb.csv files.
2.) Enter the draft picks for each team in your league into the week12db.csv file in the owner column.  Use the numbers 1-10 to represent the teams.  These numbers should correspond to the order of the league so that the schedule is correct.
3.) After the file has been edited and saved, start R.
4.) Change the working directory to the directory containing the downloaded files.  At the R command prompt, the setwd() command sets the directory and the getwd() command prints the working directory.
>> setwd('path/to/files')
5.) Type source('pigsim.R') at the R command prompt to load the data and functions.
>> source('pigsim.R')
6.) Now you are ready to start the simulation.  To run the simulation call the function dosim and pass in your team number.  If your team number is 1, then  
>> dosim(tm=1)
7.) The simulation will run 100 times by default.  The adds and drops made to your team will be printed into the console.  Every two seasons a plot will the number of wins will be updated, and at the end of the simulation the best five teams will also be printed.
